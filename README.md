## About
Bunchy Protocol is a lending market protocol bringing together the best of AAVE liquidity and NFTX pools üëªüêµüíê



## Vision
Capitalism is based on privacy property, free market and capital accumulation.
Like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches, NFT will alter thus re-define the concepts of property. NFT is the new form of capital.
Use Bunchy to accumulate on top of your NFT. 


## Problem
1 to 1 NFT collaterized loans are economically unefficient and not scalable.
NFT pool mechanism present important disagreement : when withdrawing your NFT, you have no insurance you will unlock the same one.


## Solution
A marketing making solution for NFT collaterized loan that guarantees (1) exact NFT conservation (2) immediate loan (3) evolution of collateral based on NFT live valuation.
An additional yield for lending platform liquidity providers.
We are building to allow us to accumulate on top.
